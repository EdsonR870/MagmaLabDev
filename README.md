NOTES: I was asked to complete the exersice using any languaje I knew but instead I Researched the basics of Ruby on Rails, since I thought I might as well learn the basics and do the exercise of TextileCo as the PDF document with the requirements states the technology stack is Rails and Git.

Because of this I didn't do any estimations as I've never used these technologies and also since I currently have a job and my time during office hours is occupied with it and I dedicated whatever spare time I had to this task

I'm detailing below the steps I did and an aproximation of how much time I spend on each:

Magma Lab Dev Project
1) GitHub.com - 10 min
  1.1 - Create an account and familiarize with the tool
2) Prepare Dev environment - 2 hours
  2.1 - Install Ruby on Rails
  2.2 - Installation Issues - research
3) My first basic application - 1 hour
  3.1 - Issues with the Puma Server - research
  3.2 - Yay! I'm on Rails
4) Getting Started with Rails - Research -  10 hours
  4.1 - Basic App - Articles with comments - CRUD,most basic auth,controllers,views,actions,models,SQLite3 basic tables
5) TextileCo App
