NOTES: I was asked to complete the exersice using any languaje I knew but instead I Researched the basics of Ruby on Rails, since I thought I might as well learn the basics and do the exercise of TextileCo as the PDF document with the requirements states the technology stack is Rails and Git.

Because of this I didn't do any estimations as I've never used these technologies and also since I currently have a job and my time during office hours is occupied with it and I dedicated whatever spare time I had to this task

I'm detailing below the steps I did and an aproximation of how much time I spend on each:
